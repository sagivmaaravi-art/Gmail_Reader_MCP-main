## Features

- 📤 Send emails through Gmail API
- 📥 Get inbox emails with filtering options
- 🔍 Advanced email search using Gmail query syntax
- 📧 Retrieve specific emails by ID with full content
- 📝 Access draft emails
- 📬 View sent emails

- 📁 Attachment support (send and view)
- 👥 CC and BCC recipients
- 🔐 OAuth2 authentication with Google
- 🛡️ Secure credential management
- ⚡ Fast email operations with metadata caching

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Google Cloud Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Gmail API" and enable it
4. Create credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Desktop application"
   - Download the JSON file and rename it to `credentials.json`
   - Place it in the root directory of this project
   
   **Note**: Desktop applications automatically work with the out-of-band authentication flow, so no additional redirect URI configuration is needed.
5. Configure OAuth Consent Screen:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" user type (unless you have a Google Workspace)
   - Fill in the required fields:
     - App name: "Gmail MCP Server" (or your preferred name)
     - User support email: Your email address
     - Developer contact information: Your email address
   - Add your Gmail address to "Test users" section
   - This allows you to use the app in testing mode

### 3. Authentication Setup

Complete OAuth authentication to allow the server to send emails:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will:
1. Check that `credentials.json` exists
2. Generate an authorization URL
3. Guide you through the OAuth flow
4. Save the authentication token

#### 🔍 Finding Your Authorization Code

After clicking "Allow" in the Google OAuth screen, you'll be redirected. Here's how to find your authorization code:

**Method 1: Direct Code Display (Most Common for Desktop Apps)**
- After clicking "Allow", Google shows the authorization code directly on a page
- Look for text like "Please copy this code, switch to your application and paste it there:"
- Copy the code from the text box or highlighted area


**Example Authorization Code:**
```
4/0AbCD1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
```

⚠️ **Important**: The code is usually very long (50+ characters) and starts with `4/0`

**Note**: The server reads OAuth credentials directly from `credentials.json`. You don't need to create a `.env` file unless you want to set optional configurations.

### Optional: Environment Configuration

You can optionally create a `.env` file for additional settings:

```env
# Optional: Default sender email (will use authenticated user's email if not set)
DEFAULT_SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com

# Optional: Authorization code (for automated setup)
AUTH_CODE=your_auth_code_here
```

Run the server for the first time to complete OAuth authentication:

```bash
npm start
```

Follow the authentication flow in your browser and paste the authorization code when prompted.

## Usage

### Gmail Search Query Examples

The `search_emails` and `get_inbox_emails` tools support Gmail's powerful search syntax:

- `from:sender@example.com` - Emails from specific sender
- `to:recipient@example.com` - Emails to specific recipient  
- `subject:keyword` - Emails with keyword in subject
- `has:attachment` - Emails with attachments
- `is:unread` - Unread emails
- `is:important` - Important emails
- `newer_than:7d` - Emails newer than 7 days
- `older_than:1m` - Emails older than 1 month
- `size:larger_than:10M` - Emails larger than 10MB

You can combine multiple criteria:
- `from:boss@company.com is:unread has:attachment`
- `subject:meeting newer_than:3d`
- `to:me filename:pdf older_than:1w`

## Security Notes

- OAuth2 tokens are stored locally in `token.json`
- Never commit `credentials.json`, `token.json`, or `.env` files to version control
- The server requires explicit user consent for Gmail access
- All API calls use Google's official Gmail API with proper authentication

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient Permission" Errors

**This is the most common issue when upgrading from send-only to full email access.**

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Delete old token and re-authenticate
rm token.json
npm run setup
```

**Or use the dedicated re-auth script:**
```bash
npm run reauth
```

**Why this happens:** The original authentication only requested `gmail.send` permission. The new email reading features require additional scopes (`gmail.readonly` and `gmail.modify`).

### OAuth 403: access_denied Error

If you encounter "Error 403: access_denied" or "app is currently being tested", follow these steps:

#### Quick Fix (Recommended for Personal Use):
1. **Add yourself as a test user**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Scroll down to "Test users" section
   - Click "ADD USERS" and add your Gmail address
   - Save the changes

2. **Ensure correct user type**:
   - In OAuth consent screen, make sure you selected "External" user type
   - If you selected "Internal" but don't have Google Workspace, change to "External"

3. **Clear browser cache and try again**:
   - Clear your browser's cache and cookies for Google accounts
   - Try the authentication flow again

#### Alternative: Use App Passwords (Gmail Specific)
If OAuth continues to be problematic, you can use Gmail App Passwords:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Google account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
   - Generate a password for "Mail"
3. **Use SMTP instead of Gmail API** (requires code modification)

#### For Production Use:
To remove the testing limitation permanently:
1. Complete the OAuth consent screen with all required information
2. Submit for Google verification (takes 1-4 weeks)
3. Provide privacy policy, terms of service, and app homepage
4. Once verified, any Gmail user can authorize your app

### Other Common Issues

#### "credentials.json not found"
- Ensure the file is in the project root directory
- Check the filename is exactly `credentials.json`
- Verify the file contains valid JSON

#### "Token refresh failed"
- Delete `token.json` file
- Run `npm run setup` to re-authenticate
- Ensure your OAuth2 credentials are still valid

#### "Gmail API not enabled"
- Go to Google Cloud Console
- Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
- Search for "Gmail API" and ensure it's enabled

## 🔄 Important: Re-authentication Required for Email Reading

**If you previously set up this server for sending emails only**, you'll need to re-authenticate to access inbox and email reading features. The original setup only requested `gmail.send` permission, but the new features require additional scopes.

### Quick Fix for "Insufficient Permission" Errors:

1. **Delete the existing token**:
   ```bash
   rm token.json
   ```

2. **Re-run the setup** (this will request the additional permissions):
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

3. **Follow the OAuth flow again** - this time it will request permissions for:
   - Send emails (`gmail.send`) 
   - Read emails (`gmail.readonly`)
   - Modify emails (`gmail.modify`)

### Alternative: Force Re-authentication Script

If you prefer a dedicated script:
```bash
npm run reauth
```

## Development

```bash
# Start with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test
```
